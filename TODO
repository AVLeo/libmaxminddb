* Check all memory access
* Replace all (or almost all) asserts with error codes
* Refactor reading code to unify IPv4 & IPv6 paths as well as file & mem paths
** or remove file path entirely in favor of mmap
* Rename various structs and functions to better reflect what they do
** MMDB_root_entry_s, MMDB_entry_s, MMDB_decode_all_s, MMDB_decode_s
** MMDB_get_tree
* Make MMDB_get_value work with no varargs so you can get the value of an entry
* Remove MMDB_lookup_by_ipnum and MMDB_lookup_by_ipnum_128 in favor of MMDB_lookup
* Should MMDB_pread be external? and why is it named pread?
* Same with MMDB_strcmp_result
* Hide definition of MMDB_s (and MMDB_metadata_s?) from public API
* Add accessors of some sort for metadata?
* Remove MMDB_DEFAULT_DATABASE
* Remove MMDB_BROKEN_TYPE
* Better handling of 64-bit ints - use long long?
** and is there something better for 128 bit ints?
